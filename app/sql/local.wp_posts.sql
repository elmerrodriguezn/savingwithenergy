This article will focus on the opportunities for using waste heat sources to supplement winter building heat.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"0\" frame=\"box\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th colspan=\"2\">\r\n<h2>Seven Key Sustainability Projects</h2>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>1.

common projects.  It is not the easiest type of project to implement but the amount of savings and the reduction of emissions makes this project very worthwhile.\r\nThe first question I ask in workshops is:  What is the purpose of the cooling tower located outside of your plant?  The answer:  To remove waste heat.   Second question:  Does it make sense to use a system to remove heat from your plant and then use expensive natural gas to provide heat for makeup air?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%201%20Cooling%20Tower.jpg\" alt=\"Cooling Tower\" width=\"282\" height=\"150\" border=\"0\" />    <img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%202%20Dry%20Cooler.jpg\" alt=\"Dry Cooler\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"left\">Many times I usually get the response:  The low grade heat from the coolant loop is not sufficient to provide the heat we need for our factory.  My answer:  Is the coolant loop temperature &gt;10 degrees warmer than the outside winter air temperature?  Then warming the incoming air will reduce the heating load.  Look at this table of weather data from Ohio.  There are 4,000 hours where the average temperature is less than 37 degrees!</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%203%20Weather%20Charts.jpg\" alt=\"Weather Chart\" width=\"500\" height=\"292\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Project Review</h3>\r\nLet’s begin the review of this project.  Symptoms which can help identify the opportunities for this project include:\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n 	<li>The facility has sources of waste heat such as cooling towers or furnace or equipment exhaust.</li>\r\n 	<li>The facility has a large amount of air exchange such as exhaust hoods, filtration systems, ceiling or wall exhaust fans.</li>\r\n 	<li>Winter heating is required such as natural gas forced air, steam, or hot water systems.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Air-cooled Air Compressors</h3>\r\nOne of the simplest projects to get waste heat is from an air cooled compressor.  This is a common project but I continue to find plants where this source of free heat is not being utilized.\r\nInsert Figure 4 Air Cooled Compressor Heat Recovery\r\nA key to the success of this project is to be sure to use outside makeup air for the intake and discharge the warmed air into the ceiling area of the facility, not directly blowing on an individual.\r\nTo calculate the value of this free heat use this simple formula:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/chart_e3a8_1.gif\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"49\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Coolant Loop of an Injection Molder</h3>\r\nAnother method to recover waste heat is from the coolant loop.  By intercepting the water at its warmest point before it arrives to the cooling tower and passing it through a radiator the heat in the water can be used to provide warmed make up air.\r\n\r\nThis photo shows the coolant water from an injection molding machine.  The thermal image shows the temperature of the water.  As you can see the temperature of the coolant water is significantly above the outside air temperature in the winter.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%205%20Injection%20Mold%20Coolant.jpg\" alt=\"Injection Mold Coolant\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" border=\"0\"

width=\"225\" height=\"225\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Heat Wasters</h3>\r\nThe next diagram and shows a typical installation drawing.  As with the air cooled compressor it is important that this system be set up to bring in outside makeup air and then exhaust the air into the ceiling area of the facility.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%207%20Water%20to%20Air%20Heat%20Exchanger.jpg\" alt=\"Water to Air Heat Exchanger\" width=\"500\" height=\"495\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere is a photo of what I call a “Heat Waster”.  This is exactly the type of unit that could have the discharge air ducted into the plant during the winter for free heat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/Figure%208%20Water%20to%20Air%20Heat%20Exchanger%20photo.jpg\" alt=\"Water to Air Heat Exchanger\" width=\"478\" height=\"458\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere is the formula that can help to determine the value of heat available.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/chart_e3a8_2.gif\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"49\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany plants have been able to reduce their winter heat loads using this concept.  Many, even in Michigan and Wisconsin have been able to eliminate the need for natural gas heat during production hours.\r\n\r\nI have found a company that supplies this type of heat recovery device along with some electronic measurement equipment which provides details of the amount of energy and savings that is being recovered from the coolant water.  (<a href=\"http://www.amsenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.amsenergy.com</a>) This 100 gpm radiator unit with  a metering system can cost around $25 to $30,000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eff5ea\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/Win-Win-Logo75x95-Trans.gif\" alt=\"Win-Win\" width=\"75\" height=\"95\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td>\"Combining heat recovery projects and the HVAC projects described in previous articles creates a combination where you can significantly reduce winter heat costs.\" - <em>Thomas Mort, CEM</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Free Cooling</h3>\r\nAnother area to find savings is called “free cooling”.  The concept of “free cooling” is that when the outside temperature is more than 10 degrees below the required coolant temperature the electric chiller can be bypassed and the cooling tower can be used to provide the cooling with a much lower energy use.  Many facilities, especially those with injection molding processes use electric chillers to cool molds and hydraulics.  A common temperature for the cooling loop ranges from 55 to 75 degrees.  Refer to the chart above and you can see there were more than 3,000 hours with an average temperature of 32 degrees in the Ohio.\r\n\r\nThis one line diagram shows how this type of system is configured.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%209%20Free%20Cooling%20diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Free Cooling Diagram\" width=\"311\" height=\"225\" border=\"0\" /><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%2010%20Free%20Cooling%20Plate%20and%20Frame%20HX.JPG\" alt=\"Free Cooling Picture\" width=\"169\" height=\"225\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\nCalculating the savings is based upon the following formula.\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/chart_e3a8_3.gif\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"69\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\nFree Cooling projects can often be combined with heat recovery projects and allow using much of the same equipment and getting two types of savings, electric from shutting down an electric chiller, and gas from reducing the load on the makeup air heating units.\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%2011%20free%20cooling%20and%20free%20heating.jpg\" alt=\"Free Cooling and Free Heating\" width=\"334\" height=\"242\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Summary</h3>\r\nCombining heat recovery projects together with HVAC projects described in the earlier article makes a combination where you can significantly reduce winter heat costs and have projects meeting our target of 1 year or less.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas

This article will focus on the opportunities for using waste heat sources to supplement winter building heat.\n<div>\n\n&nbsp;\n<table border=\"0\" frame=\"box\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\">\n<h2>Seven Key Sustainability Projects</h2>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1.

It is not the easiest type of project to implement but the amount of savings and the reduction of emissions makes this project very worthwhile.\nThe first question I ask in workshops is:  What is the purpose of the cooling tower located outside of your plant?  The answer:  To remove waste heat.   Second question:  Does it make sense to use a system to remove heat from your plant and then use expensive natural gas to provide heat for makeup air?\n\n&nbsp;\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%201%20Cooling%20Tower.jpg\" alt=\"Cooling Tower\" width=\"282\" height=\"150\" border=\"0\" />    <img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%202%20Dry%20Cooler.jpg\" alt=\"Dry Cooler\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n<p align=\"left\">Many times I usually get the response:  The low grade heat from the coolant loop is not sufficient to provide the heat we need for our factory.  My answer:  Is the coolant loop temperature &gt;10 degrees warmer than the outside winter air temperature?  Then warming the incoming air will reduce the heating load.  Look at this table of weather data from Ohio.  There are 4,000 hours where the average temperature is less than 37 degrees!</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%203%20Weather%20Charts.jpg\" alt=\"Weather Chart\" width=\"500\" height=\"292\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Project Review</h3>\nLet’s begin the review of this project.  Symptoms which can help identify the opportunities for this project include:\n<ol type=\"1\">\n 	<li>The facility has sources of waste heat such as cooling towers or furnace or equipment exhaust.</li>\n 	<li>The facility has a large amount of air exchange such as exhaust hoods, filtration systems, ceiling or wall exhaust fans.</li>\n 	<li>Winter heating is required such as natural gas forced air, steam, or hot water systems.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Air-cooled Air Compressors</h3>\nOne of the simplest projects to get waste heat is from an air cooled compressor.  This is a common project but I continue to find plants where this source of free heat is not being utilized.\nInsert Figure 4 Air Cooled Compressor Heat Recovery\nA key to the success of this project is to be sure to use outside makeup air for the intake and discharge the warmed air into the ceiling area of the facility, not directly blowing on an individual.\nTo calculate the value of this free heat use this simple formula:\n\n&nbsp;\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/chart_e3a8_1.gif\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"49\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Coolant Loop of an Injection Molder</h3>\nAnother method to recover waste heat is from the coolant loop.  By intercepting the water at its warmest point before it arrives to the cooling tower and passing it through a radiator the heat in the water can be used to provide warmed make up air.\n\nThis photo shows the coolant water from an injection molding machine.  The thermal image shows the temperature of the water.  As you can see the temperature of the coolant water is significantly above the outside air temperature in the winter.\n\n&nbsp;\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%205%20Injection%20Mold%20Coolant.jpg\" alt=\"Injection Mold

height=\"225\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Heat Wasters</h3>\nThe next diagram and shows a typical installation drawing.  As with the air cooled compressor it is important that this system be set up to bring in outside makeup air and then exhaust the air into the ceiling area of the facility.\n\n&nbsp;\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%207%20Water%20to%20Air%20Heat%20Exchanger.jpg\" alt=\"Water to Air Heat Exchanger\" width=\"500\" height=\"495\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is a photo of what I call a “Heat Waster”.  This is exactly the type of unit that could have the discharge air ducted into the plant during the winter for free heat.\n\n&nbsp;\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/Figure%208%20Water%20to%20Air%20Heat%20Exchanger%20photo.jpg\" alt=\"Water to Air Heat Exchanger\" width=\"478\" height=\"458\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is the formula that can help to determine the value of heat available.\n\n&nbsp;\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/chart_e3a8_2.gif\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"49\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n\nMany plants have been able to reduce their winter heat loads using this concept.  Many, even in Michigan and Wisconsin have been able to eliminate the need for natural gas heat during production hours.\n\nI have found a company that supplies this type of heat recovery device along with some electronic measurement equipment which provides details of the amount of energy and savings that is being recovered from the coolant water.  (<a href=\"http://www.amsenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.amsenergy.com</a>) This 100 gpm radiator unit with  a metering system can cost around $25 to $30,000.\n\n&nbsp;\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eff5ea\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/Win-Win-Logo75x95-Trans.gif\" alt=\"Win-Win\" width=\"75\" height=\"95\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td>\"Combining heat recovery projects and the HVAC projects described in previous articles creates a combination where you can significantly reduce winter heat costs.\" - <em>Thomas Mort, CEM</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Free Cooling</h3>\nAnother area to find savings is called “free cooling”.  The concept of “free cooling” is that when the outside temperature is more than 10 degrees below the required coolant temperature the electric chiller can be bypassed and the cooling tower can be used to provide the cooling with a much lower energy use.  Many facilities, especially those with injection molding processes use electric chillers to cool molds and hydraulics.  A common temperature for the cooling loop ranges from 55 to 75 degrees.  Refer to the chart above and you can see there were more than 3,000 hours with an average temperature of 32 degrees in the Ohio.\n\nThis one line diagram shows how this type of system is configured.\n\n&nbsp;\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%209%20Free%20Cooling%20diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Free Cooling Diagram\" width=\"311\" height=\"225\" border=\"0\" /><img

border=\"0\" /></p>\nCalculating the savings is based upon the following formula.\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/chart_e3a8_3.gif\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"69\" border=\"0\" /></p>\nFree Cooling projects can often be combined with heat recovery projects and allow using much of the same equipment and getting two types of savings, electric from shutting down an electric chiller, and gas from reducing the load on the makeup air heating units.\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/imagefield_thumbs/Figure%2011%20free%20cooling%20and%20free%20heating.jpg\" alt=\"Free Cooling and Free Heating\" width=\"334\" height=\"242\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Summary</h3>\nCombining heat recovery projects together with HVAC projects described in the earlier article makes a combination where you can significantly reduce winter heat costs and have projects meeting our target of 1 year or less.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas Mort</a> is a Senior

My studies have found 7 key (or common) areas where low cost practical projects can be implemented. Combined, these projects provide savings exceeding 10% of the annual energy spend of a typical industrial facility - with an average payback of less than one year.\n\nThis month’s article will focus on Lighting. Optimizing the lighting system can help reduce annual energy costs by approximately 2%. Lighting is a popular energy saving project and many facilities have already begun projects in this area. Often some key points are overlooked resulting in project costs being higher than necessary. Understanding the correct requirements can significantly reduce capital costs.\n<h3>Lighting Energy Costs and Project Objectives</h3>\nThe factory used for this example is a facility with 149,000 sq. ft. including manufacturing floor, warehouse, and office areas. The factory produces small metal and plastic injection-molded components. The annual energy spend for the facility is $1,483,000. There are 125 Metal Halide light fixtures and 355 fluorescent light fixtures. Lighting energy costs are 4.5% of the total energy spend or $67,200 per year. The objective of a lighting optimization project is to:\n\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the <strong>correct amount</strong> of light at the <strong>correct time</strong> with <strong>efficient fixtures</strong>.\n\nSymptoms which can help identify the need for a lighting project include:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Light levels are higher than necessary for the type of work being accomplished.</li>\n 	<li>Light fixtures are at a greater distance than necessary from the work area or in improper position.</li>\n 	<li>Excess lights are operating in areas without people working under the lights.</li>\n 	<li>The current light fixtures are not high efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image1_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#1 400 watt metal halide light fixtures.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image2_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#2 These 6 bulb T-8 Fluorescent fixtures use 50% less energy</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #1: Understand Current Lighting Status</h3>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image3.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#3 Lights near windows are wasting energy.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image4.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#4 Often light fixtures are obstructed.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nIf minimizing capital expenditure is important, then the sequential steps of a lighting project need to be followed. The first step is to understand your current lighting status. This would include a survey of the major facility areas such as the manufacturing floor and warehouses. The survey should include the following:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Number of fixtures</li>\n 	<li>Bulb type and watts per bulb (example: 400 watt MH or 96 watt T12x4 ft fluorescent)</li>\n 	<li>Number of bulbs per fixture</li>\n 	<li>Hours per week the fixture is on without someone working under the fixture. (reference photos #5 and #9)</li>\n 	<li>Is it possible to move the fixture closer to the work areas such as lowering it down or aligning it so the light is not blocked by an obstruction? (reference photo #4 and #8)</li>\n 	<li>Is ambient light available from windows or skylights which may allow the light fixture to be off during sunlight hours? (reference photos #6 and #7)</li>\n 	<li>Is the light level reduced in non-precision work areas such as walk-ways and storage when compared to work-station areas?</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image5.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#5 Lights on without workers and excessive lighting in non-work areas.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #2: Determine Existing Energy Costs</h3>\nThe second step is to determine the value of changing the status of the existing light fixtures. For this example, I will consider the 440 watt Metal Halide light fixtures which are commonly used in many industrial facilities. The current energy cost of the 125 Metal Halide light fixtures is $46,563 per year.\n\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n125 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $46,563 /year\n<h3>Step #3: Determine the Correct Amount of Light:</h3>\nThere were sixty (60) fixtures which could be moved closer to the work area. By moving them closer, we were able to eliminate twenty (20) fixtures resulting in a energy savings of $7,450.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image6.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#6 A simple light sensor can shut down lights when the sun is shining.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n20 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hrs/week X 50 weeks per yr X $0.102/kwh = $7,450 /year\n<h3>Step #4: Use Lighting Only When Needed:</h3>\nTurning off the lights when a person is not working under the lights is another opportunity. Using occupancy sensors, we found thirty (30) lights in storage areas and warehouse aisles that could be turned off an additional eighty (80) hours per week. The savings was $5,385.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image7.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#7 These lights are turned off by sensors when the sunlight is available.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n30 X 440 watts/1,000 X 80 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $5,385 /year\n<h3>Step #5: Use Energy-Efficient Fixtures:</h3>\nUpgrading the lights to high-efficiency light fixtures will reduce the energy use per fixture by 50% and use 220 watts per fixture vs the original 440 watt. Remember we eliminated 20 lights and reduced the hours of 30 more lights. (Reference photos #1 and #2)\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image8.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#8 Lowering the lights from the ceiling reduces energy waste.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n75 X 220 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $13,969 /year\n\n30 X 220 watts/1,000 X 86 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $2,895 /year\n\nTotal savings for high efficiency = $16,846/year\n<h3>Step #6: Calculate total Energy Savings and ROI</h3>\nThe total energy savings per year is $29,681. This is the sum of upgrading lights to high efficency fixtures ($16,846 savings), using lights only when needed ($5,385), and providing the correct amount of light ($7,450).\n\nThe costs involved with generating these savings include:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Materials: the light fixture used to replace the 440 watt metal halide fixture is a T8 6 lamp fluorescent fixture, 32 watts per bulb. The cost is $205.00 USD including the motion sensor, the electrical cord and plug, hangars, and safety chain. Calculation: 105 new fixtures x $205.00 = $21,525 for the cost of the project.</li>\n 	<li>Labor: In house labor was used to install the fixtures-no cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image9.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#9 An occupancy sensor can help determine the amount of time lights are on without people in the area.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nIn this lighting optimization project, annual energy savings were $29,681 with project costs of $21,525. The simple ROI on the project is 8.7 months.\n<h3>Audits and Surveys</h3>\nLighting vendors are often willing to help perform your lighting surveys and provide recommendations for a higher efficiency lighting scheme. Be sure to ask them to consider occupancy rates and light intensity levels for different areas. If you receive a quotation for new fixtures I recommend that you request to have the quotation written with line item cost for each type of fixture and sets of fixtures including the current energy usage, proposed energy usage and savings for each. Review the quotation and identify the fixtures which do not have a good payback and eliminate them from the project. Often this process of elimination will help you to reduce the overall project cost and result in an excellent ROI.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the correct amount of light at the correct time with efficient fixtures.\n\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas Mort</a> is a Senior Auditor with Thomas Mort Consulting.</em>","Seven Sustainability Projects: Lighting Optimization","This month’s article will focus on Lighting.

The survey should include the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Number of fixtures</li>\r\n 	<li>Bulb type and watts per bulb (example: 400 watt MH or 96 watt T12x4 ft fluorescent)</li>\r\n 	<li>Number of bulbs per fixture</li>\r\n 	<li>Hours per week the fixture is on without someone working under the fixture. (reference photos #5 and #9)</li>\r\n 	<li>Is it possible to move the fixture closer to the work areas such as lowering it down or aligning it so the light is not blocked by an obstruction? (reference photo #4 and #8)</li>\r\n 	<li>Is ambient light available from windows or skylights which may allow the light fixture to be off during sunlight hours? (reference photos #6 and #7)</li>\r\n 	<li>Is the light level reduced in non-precision work areas such as walk-ways and storage when compared to work-station areas?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image5.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>#5 Lights on without workers and excessive lighting in non-work areas.</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Step #2: Determine Existing Energy Costs</h3>\r\nThe second step is to determine the value of changing the status of the existing light fixtures. For this example, I will consider the 440 watt Metal Halide light fixtures which are commonly used in many industrial facilities. The current energy cost of the 125 Metal Halide light fixtures is $46,563 per year.\r\n\r\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\r\n\r\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\r\n\r\n125 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $46,563 /year\r\n<h3>Step #3: Determine the Correct Amount of Light:</h3>\r\nThere were sixty (60) fixtures which could be moved closer to the work area. By moving them closer, we were able to eliminate twenty (20) fixtures resulting in a energy savings of $7,450.\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image6.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>#6 A simple light sensor can shut down lights when the sun is shining.</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\r\n\r\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\r\n\r\n20 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hrs/week X 50 weeks per yr X $0.102/kwh = $7,450 /year\r\n<h3>Step #4: Use Lighting Only When Needed:</h3>\r\nTurning off the lights when a person is not working under the lights is another opportunity. Using occupancy sensors, we found thirty (30) lights in storage areas and warehouse aisles that could be turned off an additional eighty (80) hours per week. The savings was $5,385.\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image7.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>#7 These lights are turned off by sensors when the sunlight is available.</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\r\n\r\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\r\n\r\n30 X 440 watts/1,000 X 80 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $5,385 /year\r\n<h3>Step #5: Use Energy-Efficient Fixtures:</h3>\r\nUpgrading the lights to high-efficiency light fixtures will reduce the energy use per fixture by 50% and use 220 watts per fixture vs the original 440 watt. Remember we eliminated 20 lights and reduced the hours of 30 more lights. (Reference photos #1 and #2)\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image8.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>#8 Lowering the lights from the ceiling reduces energy waste.</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\r\n\r\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\r\n\r\n75 X 220 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $13,969 /year\r\n\r\n30 X 220 watts/1,000 X 86 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $2,895 /year\r\n\r\nTotal savings for high efficiency = $16,846/year\r\n<h3>Step #6: Calculate total Energy Savings and ROI</h3>\r\nThe total energy savings per year is $29,681. This is the sum of upgrading lights to high efficency fixtures ($16,846 savings), using lights only when needed ($5,385), and providing the correct amount of light ($7,450).\r\n\r\nThe costs involved with generating these savings include:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Materials: the light fixture used to replace the 440 watt metal halide fixture is a T8 6 lamp fluorescent fixture, 32 watts per bulb. The cost is $205.00 USD including the motion sensor, the electrical cord and plug, hangars, and safety chain. Calculation: 105 new fixtures x $205.00 = $21,525 for the cost of the project.</li>\r\n 	<li>Labor: In house labor was used to install the fixtures-no cost.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image9.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>#9 An occupancy sensor can help determine the amount of time lights are on without people in the area.</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\nIn this lighting optimization project, annual energy savings were $29,681 with project costs of $21,525. The simple ROI on the project is 8.7 months.\r\n<h3>Audits and Surveys</h3>\r\nLighting vendors are often willing to help perform your lighting surveys and provide recommendations for a higher efficiency lighting scheme. Be sure to ask them to consider occupancy rates and light intensity levels for different areas. If you receive a quotation for new fixtures I recommend that you request to have the quotation written with line item cost for each type of fixture and sets of fixtures including the current energy usage, proposed energy usage and savings for each. Review the quotation and identify the fixtures which do not have a good payback and eliminate them from the project. Often this process of elimination will help you to reduce the overall project cost and result in an excellent ROI.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the correct amount of light at the correct time with efficient fixtures.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas Mort</a> is a Senior Auditor with Thomas Mort Consulting.</em>\r\n\r\nTo read <strong>the next six Sustainability Projects</strong> from this series please make your selection below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/hvac-systems/seven-sustainability-projects-heat-recovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heat Recovery</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/hvac-systems/seven-sustainability-projects-hvac-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HVAC Optimization</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/lighting/project-implementation/sustainability-projects/lighting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Implementation</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/technology/instrumentation/seven-sustainability-projects-metering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metering</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/system-assessments/compressor-controls/seven-sustainability-projects-air-compressors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Air Compressors</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/bill-mgmt/demand-control/seven-sustainability-projects-demand-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand Control</a>","Seven Sustainability Projects: Lighting Optimization","","inherit","closed","closed","","8-revision-v1","","","2018-10-17 23:33:47","2018-10-17 23:33:47","",8,"http://savingwithenergy.local/8-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

My studies have found 7 key (or common) areas where low cost practical projects can be implemented. Combined, these projects provide savings exceeding 10% of the annual energy spend with an average payback of less than one year.\n\nThis month’s article will focus on Demand Control. Electricity for most industrial facilities has two or more costs. First there is the energy cost which is measured as kilowatt hours (kWh) and then there is the demand cost measured at kilowatts (kW). Understanding the costs of these two units and also how the time of use is related is an important part of managing your energy costs. The utility term for this is Tariff Rate Schedule.\n<h3>Demand Control Project Objectives</h3>\nWe can describe our demand control project as an effort to reduce the cost of energy by minimizing the use of electricity during the peak demand periods. Symptoms which can help identify the opportunity for a demand control project include:\n<ol type=\"1\">\n 	<li>The tariff schedule shows a demand charge and energy charge.</li>\n 	<li>The facility has equipment loads which operate less than 24 hours per day.</li>\n 	<li>The electric load profile shows demand peaks.</li>\n 	<li>There are equipment loads which can be interrupted for period of &gt;15 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step #1: Gather Data</h3>\nTo begin an effective Demand Control project some data needs to be gathered. First, you will need to know the Tariff Rate Schedule. This can be achieved from your utility bill, local utility representative, or it is often posted on the utility websites.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%201%20Tariff%20Table_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 1: Tariff Table</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nFrom this table we can see that though the cost of electricity is $0.102/kWh the energy cost portion is between $0.082 and $0.066 depending on the time of day the energy is used. Also the demand portion of the energy cost is $12.00 per kW. This is the part we will focus on for this project.\n<h3>Step #2: Understand the Demand Charge</h3>\nA demand charge of $12.00 per kW means that the utility company measures the electricity usage every 15 minutes for the whole month. The peak energy use of the month is called the demand and is multiplied by the $12.00 to determine the demand charge.\n\nA demand profile as shown in figure 2 shows the 15 minute electric readings in the form of a graph. From this graph we can see the peak demand was 1,720 kW. This data is usually available directly from the utility company. Some utilities provide this without charge and others with a small charge per month will give you access to see this type of detailed data from your computer.\n\n1,720 kW x $12.00 per kW = $20,640. The total electric bill was $76,512. The demand cost was 27% of the total cost! Every kW that we can reduce from this peak is worth $12.00 for each month or $144.00 per year.\n\nLooking closely at the graph we can see that the peak occurs mid day and lasts approximately 1.5 hours. If we could reduce this peak to a maximum of 1,600 kW we could reduce our demand by 120 kW. 120 kW x $12.00/kW x 12 months per year = $17,280 per year. This is almost 2% of our total electric spend.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%202%20Interval%20Data_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 2: Interval Data</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #3: Reduce Peak Demand by Peak Shaving and/or Load Shifting</h3>\nReducing the peak demand is often referred to as Peak Shaving or Load Shifting. The next step is to determine which pieces of equipment are causing this peak to occur. I have found that using electronic data loggers is a good way to find the guilty equipment and to have measured data to support the project.\n\nIdentify major electric-using equipment that does not run 24 hours per day. Install a data logger on the devices and record the energy usage for a period of one week. Especially look for “batch” type processes. They may only be run a few times per day or week. These are often the guilty component to causing extra peak demand charges.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%203%20Data%20Logger%20installed_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 3 : The data logger is installed in the equipment power cabinet</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nOnce data loggers are installed, one can get a picture of when different pieces of equipment are operating and how it relates to over-all demand charges. Figure 4 shows the results of four pieces of equipment and the results are aligned with the total electric profile for the plant. The shaded bar shows the peak period when electricity is most expensive. In this example we found a few pieces of equipment that with only a few hour changes in the operating schedule could reduce the demand charge significantly. The idea is to operate equipment outside of the peak demand period. In the beginning, the operations manager did not want to consider changing equipment schedules. After being presented with a clear graph and the dollar value he changed the equipment schedules.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%204%20Equipment%20Load%20Profiles_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 4: Equipment Load Profiles</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #4: Demand Shaving</h3>\nAnother method is referred to as Demand Shaving. The idea is to find equipment which could be shut off or slowed down for a short period of time when a peak period is approaching. The type of equipment that is usually shut down or slowed down includes hot water heaters, cooling tower fans, electric ovens, and air conditioning systems.\n\nThe chart in Figure 5 shows the change in the electric profile that can be accomplished by using a demand shaving control system. The left side of the chart shows the load profile with the control system off and the right side shows the control system on.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%205%20Demand%20Controller%20Results_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 5: Demand Controller Results</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nDemand Shaving often requires that some automatic equipment be installed which monitors the actual energy usage and is programmed with a set of rules to determine which equipment can be shut down or slowed down and for how long. An example of a company to review is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.poweritsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.poweritsolutions.com.</a>\n\nThere is another advantage to being able to perform demand shaving. Many locations in the country will pay large amounts of money to reduce your load during periods or peak demand for the utility company. Companies have formed Demand Response organizations. Often factories can receive more than $100 per kW for short period reductions in load. An example of a company that performs this service is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.northamericapowerpartners.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.northamericapowerpartners.com.</a>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nIn summary, electricity costs different amounts depending on the time of day you use it. Moving equipment to operate during the periods of lower cost can save a lot of money. Interval data is key to understanding the situation, followed by measuring the load profiles of individual pieces of equipment.\n\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas Mort</a>&nbsp;is a Senior Auditor with Thomas Mort Consulting.</em>\n\nTo read&nbsp;<strong>the next six Sustainability Projects</strong>&nbsp;from this series please make your selection below:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/technology/instrumentation/seven-sustainability-projects-metering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metering</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/hvac-systems/seven-sustainability-projects-hvac-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HVAC Optimization</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/lighting/project-implementation/sustainability-projects/lighting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Implementation</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/lighting/seven-sustainability-projects-lighting-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lighting Optimization</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/hvac-systems/seven-sustainability-projects-heat-recovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heat Recovery</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/system-assessments/compressor-controls/seven-sustainability-projects-air-compressors\">Air Compressors</a>","Seven Sustainability Projects: Demand Control","","publish","open","open","","seven-sustainability-projects-demand-control","","","2018-10-18 16:26:39","2018-10-18 16:26:39","",0,"http://savingwithenergy.local/?p=10",0,"post","",0),

(13,1,"2018-10-17 23:45:14","2018-10-17 23:45:14","<div>\r\n<h2>Overview</h2>\r\n</div>\r\nReducing energy costs and pollution emissions involves many areas within an industrial facility. My studies have found 7 key (or common) areas where low cost practical projects can be implemented. Combined, these projects provide savings exceeding 10% of the annual energy spend with an average payback of less than one year.\r\n\r\nThis month’s article will focus on Demand Control. Electricity for most industrial facilities has two or more costs. First there is the energy cost which is measured as kilowatt hours (kWh) and then there is the demand cost measured at kilowatts (kW). Understanding the costs of these two units and also how the time of use is related is an important part of managing your energy costs. The utility term for this is Tariff Rate Schedule.\r\n<h3>Demand Control Project Objectives</h3>\r\nWe can describe our demand control project as an effort to reduce the cost of energy by minimizing the use of electricity during the peak demand periods. Symptoms which can help identify the opportunity for a demand control project include:\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n 	<li>The tariff schedule shows a demand charge and energy charge.</li>\r\n 	<li>The facility has equipment loads which operate less than 24 hours per day.</li>\r\n 	<li>The electric load profile shows demand peaks.</li>\r\n 	<li>There are equipment loads which can be interrupted for period of &gt;15 minutes.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Step #1: Gather Data</h3>\r\nTo begin an effective Demand Control project some data needs to be gathered. First, you will need to know the Tariff Rate Schedule. This can be achieved from your utility bill, local utility representative, or it is often posted on the utility websites.\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%201%20Tariff%20Table_th.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>Figure 1: Tariff Table</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\nFrom this table we can see that though the cost of electricity is $0.102/kWh the energy cost portion is between $0.082 and $0.066 depending on the time of day the energy is used. Also the demand portion of the energy cost is $12.00 per kW. This is the part we will focus on for this project.\r\n<h3>Step #2: Understand the Demand Charge</h3>\r\nA demand charge of $12.00 per kW means that the utility company measures the electricity usage every 15 minutes for the whole month. The peak energy use of the month is called the demand and is multiplied by the $12.00 to determine the demand charge.\r\n\r\nA demand profile as shown in figure 2 shows the 15 minute electric readings in the form of a graph. From this graph we can see the peak demand was 1,720 kW. This data is usually available directly from the utility company. Some utilities provide this without charge and others with a small charge per month will give you access to see this type of detailed data from your computer.\r\n\r\n1,720 kW x $12.00 per kW = $20,640. The total electric bill was $76,512. The demand cost was 27% of the total cost! Every kW that we can reduce from this peak is worth $12.00 for each month or $144.00 per year.\r\n\r\nLooking closely at the graph we can see that the peak occurs mid day and lasts approximately 1.5 hours. If we could reduce this peak to a maximum of 1,600 kW we could reduce our demand by 120 kW. 120 kW x $12.00/kW x 12 months per year = $17,280 per year. This is almost 2% of our total electric spend.\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%202%20Interval%20Data_th.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>Figure 2: Interval Data</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Step #3: Reduce Peak Demand by Peak Shaving and/or Load Shifting</h3>\r\nReducing the peak demand is often referred to as Peak Shaving or Load Shifting. The next step is to determine which pieces of equipment are causing this peak to occur. I have found that using electronic data loggers is a good way to find the guilty equipment and to have measured data to support the project.\r\n\r\nIdentify major electric-using equipment that does not run 24 hours per day. Install a data logger on the devices and record the energy usage for a period of one week. Especially look for “batch” type processes. They may only be run a few times per day or week. These are often the guilty component to causing extra peak demand charges.\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%203%20Data%20Logger%20installed_th.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>Figure 3 : The data logger is installed in the equipment power cabinet</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\nOnce data loggers are installed, one can get a picture of when different pieces of equipment are operating and how it relates to over-all demand charges. Figure 4 shows the results of four pieces of equipment and the results are aligned with the total electric profile for the plant. The shaded bar shows the peak period when electricity is most expensive. In this example we found a few pieces of equipment that with only a few hour changes in the operating schedule could reduce the demand charge significantly. The idea is to operate equipment outside of the peak demand period. In the beginning, the operations manager did not want to consider changing equipment schedules. After being presented with a clear graph and the dollar value he changed the equipment schedules.\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%204%20Equipment%20Load%20Profiles_th.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>Figure 4: Equipment Load Profiles</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Step #4: Demand Shaving</h3>\r\nAnother method is referred to as Demand Shaving. The idea is to find equipment which could be shut off or slowed down for a short period of time when a peak period is approaching. The type of equipment that is usually shut down or slowed down includes hot water heaters, cooling tower fans, electric ovens, and air conditioning systems.\r\n\r\nThe chart in Figure 5 shows the change in the electric profile that can be accomplished by using a demand shaving control system. The left side of the chart shows the load profile with the control system off and the right side shows the control system on.\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%205%20Demand%20Controller%20Results_th.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td>Figure 5: Demand Controller Results</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\nDemand Shaving often requires that some automatic equipment be installed which monitors the actual energy usage and is programmed with a set of rules to determine which equipment can be shut down or slowed down and for how long.

My studies have found 7 key (or common) areas where low cost practical projects can be implemented. Combined, these projects provide savings exceeding 10% of the annual energy spend with an average payback of less than one year.\n\nThis month’s article will focus on Demand Control. Electricity for most industrial facilities has two or more costs. First there is the energy cost which is measured as kilowatt hours (kWh) and then there is the demand cost measured at kilowatts (kW). Understanding the costs of these two units and also how the time of use is related is an important part of managing your energy costs. The utility term for this is Tariff Rate Schedule.\n<h3>Demand Control Project Objectives</h3>\nWe can describe our demand control project as an effort to reduce the cost of energy by minimizing the use of electricity during the peak demand periods. Symptoms which can help identify the opportunity for a demand control project include:\n<ol type=\"1\">\n 	<li>The tariff schedule shows a demand charge and energy charge.</li>\n 	<li>The facility has equipment loads which operate less than 24 hours per day.</li>\n 	<li>The electric load profile shows demand peaks.</li>\n 	<li>There are equipment loads which can be interrupted for period of &gt;15 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step #1: Gather Data</h3>\nTo begin an effective Demand Control project some data needs to be gathered. First, you will need to know the Tariff Rate Schedule. This can be achieved from your utility bill, local utility representative, or it is often posted on the utility websites.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%201%20Tariff%20Table_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 1: Tariff Table</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nFrom this table we can see that though the cost of electricity is $0.102/kWh the energy cost portion is between $0.082 and $0.066 depending on the time of day the energy is used. Also the demand portion of the energy cost is $12.00 per kW. This is the part we will focus on for this project.\n<h3>Step #2: Understand the Demand Charge</h3>\nA demand charge of $12.00 per kW means that the utility company measures the electricity usage every 15 minutes for the whole month. The peak energy use of the month is called the demand and is multiplied by the $12.00 to determine the demand charge.\n\nA demand profile as shown in figure 2 shows the 15 minute electric readings in the form of a graph. From this graph we can see the peak demand was 1,720 kW. This data is usually available directly from the utility company. Some utilities provide this without charge and others with a small charge per month will give you access to see this type of detailed data from your computer.\n\n1,720 kW x $12.00 per kW = $20,640. The total electric bill was $76,512. The demand cost was 27% of the total cost! Every kW that we can reduce from this peak is worth $12.00 for each month or $144.00 per year.\n\nLooking closely at the graph we can see that the peak occurs mid day and lasts approximately 1.5 hours. If we could reduce this peak to a maximum of 1,600 kW we could reduce our demand by 120 kW. 120 kW x $12.00/kW x 12 months per year = $17,280 per year. This is almost 2% of our total electric spend.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%202%20Interval%20Data_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 2: Interval Data</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #3: Reduce Peak Demand by Peak Shaving and/or Load Shifting</h3>\nReducing the peak demand is often referred to as Peak Shaving or Load Shifting. The next step is to determine which pieces of equipment are causing this peak to occur. I have found that using electronic data loggers is a good way to find the guilty equipment and to have measured data to support the project.\n\nIdentify major electric-using equipment that does not run 24 hours per day. Install a data logger on the devices and record the energy usage for a period of one week. Especially look for “batch” type processes. They may only be run a few times per day or week. These are often the guilty component to causing extra peak demand charges.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%203%20Data%20Logger%20installed_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 3 : The data logger is installed in the equipment power cabinet</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nOnce data loggers are installed, one can get a picture of when different pieces of equipment are operating and how it relates to over-all demand charges. Figure 4 shows the results of four pieces of equipment and the results are aligned with the total electric profile for the plant. The shaded bar shows the peak period when electricity is most expensive. In this example we found a few pieces of equipment that with only a few hour changes in the operating schedule could reduce the demand charge significantly. The idea is to operate equipment outside of the peak demand period. In the beginning, the operations manager did not want to consider changing equipment schedules. After being presented with a clear graph and the dollar value he changed the equipment schedules.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%204%20Equipment%20Load%20Profiles_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 4: Equipment Load Profiles</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #4: Demand Shaving</h3>\nAnother method is referred to as Demand Shaving. The idea is to find equipment which could be shut off or slowed down for a short period of time when a peak period is approaching. The type of equipment that is usually shut down or slowed down includes hot water heaters, cooling tower fans, electric ovens, and air conditioning systems.\n\nThe chart in Figure 5 shows the change in the electric profile that can be accomplished by using a demand shaving control system. The left side of the chart shows the load profile with the control system off and the right side shows the control system on.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/Figure%205%20Demand%20Controller%20Results_th.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Figure 5: Demand Controller Results</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nDemand Shaving often requires that some automatic equipment be installed which monitors the actual energy usage and is programmed with a set of rules to determine which equipment can be shut down or slowed down and for how long. An example of a company to review is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.poweritsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.poweritsolutions.com.</a>\n\nThere is another advantage to being able to perform demand shaving. Many locations in the country will pay large amounts of money to reduce your load during periods or peak demand for the utility company. Companies have formed Demand Response organizations. Often factories can receive more than $100 per kW for short period reductions in load. An example of a company that performs this service is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.northamericapowerpartners.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.northamericapowerpartners.com.</a>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nIn summary, electricity costs different amounts depending on the time of day you use it. Moving equipment to operate during the periods of lower cost can save a lot of money. Interval data is key to understanding the situation, followed by measuring the load profiles of individual pieces of equipment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas Mort</a>&nbsp;is a Senior Auditor with Thomas Mort Consulting.</em>\n\nTo read&nbsp;<strong>the next six Sustainability Projects</strong>&nbsp;from this series please make your selection below:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/technology/instrumentation/seven-sustainability-projects-metering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metering</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/hvac-systems/seven-sustainability-projects-hvac-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HVAC Optimization</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/lighting/project-implementation/sustainability-projects/lighting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Implementation</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/lighting/seven-sustainability-projects-lighting-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lighting Optimization</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/hvac-systems/seven-sustainability-projects-heat-recovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heat Recovery</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/system-assessments/compressor-controls/seven-sustainability-projects-air-compressors\">Air Compressors</a>","Seven Sustainability Projects: Demand Control","","inherit","closed","closed","","10-revision-v1","","","2018-10-18 16:22:38","2018-10-18 16:22:38","",10,"http://savingwithenergy.local/10-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

My studies have found 7 key (or common) areas where low cost practical projects can be implemented. Combined, these projects provide savings exceeding 10% of the annual energy spend of a typical industrial facility - with an average payback of less than one year.\n\nThis month’s article will focus on Lighting. Optimizing the lighting system can help reduce annual energy costs by approximately 2%. Lighting is a popular energy saving project and many facilities have already begun projects in this area. Often some key points are overlooked resulting in project costs being higher than necessary. Understanding the correct requirements can significantly reduce capital costs.\n<h3>Lighting Energy Costs and Project Objectives</h3>\nThe factory used for this example is a facility with 149,000 sq. ft. including manufacturing floor, warehouse, and office areas. The factory produces small metal and plastic injection-molded components. The annual energy spend for the facility is $1,483,000. There are 125 Metal Halide light fixtures and 355 fluorescent light fixtures. Lighting energy costs are 4.5% of the total energy spend or $67,200 per year. The objective of a lighting optimization project is to:\n\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the&nbsp;<strong>correct amount</strong>&nbsp;of light at the&nbsp;<strong>correct time</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>efficient fixtures</strong>.\n\nSymptoms which can help identify the need for a lighting project include:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Light levels are higher than necessary for the type of work being accomplished.</li>\n 	<li>Light fixtures are at a greater distance than necessary from the work area or in improper position.</li>\n 	<li>Excess lights are operating in areas without people working under the lights.</li>\n 	<li>The current light fixtures are not high efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image1_0.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#1 400 watt metal halide light fixtures.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image2_0.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#2 These 6 bulb T-8 Fluorescent fixtures use 50% less energy</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #1: Understand Current Lighting Status</h3>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image3.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#3 Lights near windows are wasting energy.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image4.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#4 Often light fixtures are obstructed.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nIf minimizing capital expenditure is important, then the sequential steps of a lighting project need to be followed. The first step is to understand your current lighting status. This would include a survey of the major facility areas such as the manufacturing floor and warehouses. The survey should include the following:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Number of fixtures</li>\n 	<li>Bulb type and watts per bulb (example: 400 watt MH or 96 watt T12x4 ft fluorescent)</li>\n 	<li>Number of bulbs per fixture</li>\n 	<li>Hours per week the fixture is on without someone working under the fixture.

(reference photo #4 and #8)</li>\n 	<li>Is ambient light available from windows or skylights which may allow the light fixture to be off during sunlight hours? (reference photos #6 and #7)</li>\n 	<li>Is the light level reduced in non-precision work areas such as walk-ways and storage when compared to work-station areas?</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image5.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#5 Lights on without workers and excessive lighting in non-work areas.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #2: Determine Existing Energy Costs</h3>\nThe second step is to determine the value of changing the status of the existing light fixtures. For this example, I will consider the 440 watt Metal Halide light fixtures which are commonly used in many industrial facilities. The current energy cost of the 125 Metal Halide light fixtures is $46,563 per year.\n\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n125 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $46,563 /year\n<h3>Step #3: Determine the Correct Amount of Light:</h3>\nThere were sixty (60) fixtures which could be moved closer to the work area. By moving them closer, we were able to eliminate twenty (20) fixtures resulting in a energy savings of $7,450.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image6.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#6 A simple light sensor can shut down lights when the sun is shining.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n20 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hrs/week X 50 weeks per yr X $0.102/kwh = $7,450 /year\n<h3>Step #4: Use Lighting Only When Needed:</h3>\nTurning off the lights when a person is not working under the lights is another opportunity. Using occupancy sensors, we found thirty (30) lights in storage areas and warehouse aisles that could be turned off an additional eighty (80) hours per week. The savings was $5,385.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image7.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#7 These lights are turned off by sensors when the sunlight is available.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n30 X 440 watts/1,000 X 80 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $5,385 /year\n<h3>Step #5: Use Energy-Efficient Fixtures:</h3>\nUpgrading the lights to high-efficiency light fixtures will reduce the energy use per fixture by 50% and use 220 watts per fixture vs the original 440 watt. Remember we eliminated 20 lights and reduced the hours of 30 more lights. (Reference photos #1 and #2)\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image8.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#8 Lowering the lights from the ceiling reduces energy waste.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n75 X 220 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $13,969 /year\n\n30 X 220 watts/1,000 X 86 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $2,895 /year\n\nTotal savings for high efficiency = $16,846/year\n<h3>Step #6: Calculate total Energy Savings and ROI</h3>\nThe total energy savings per year is $29,681. This is the sum of upgrading lights to high efficency fixtures ($16,846 savings), using lights only when needed ($5,385), and providing the correct amount of light ($7,450).\n\nThe costs involved with generating these savings include:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Materials: the light fixture used to replace the 440 watt metal halide fixture is a T8 6 lamp fluorescent fixture, 32 watts per bulb. The cost is $205.00 USD including the motion sensor, the electrical cord and plug, hangars, and safety chain. Calculation: 105 new fixtures x $205.00 = $21,525 for the cost of the project.</li>\n 	<li>Labor: In house labor was used to install the fixtures-no cost.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image9.jpg\" border=\"0\"></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#9 An occupancy sensor can help determine the amount of time lights are on without people in the area.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nIn this lighting optimization project, annual energy savings were $29,681 with project costs of $21,525. The simple ROI on the project is 8.7 months.\n<h3>Audits and Surveys</h3>\nLighting vendors are often willing to help perform your lighting surveys and provide recommendations for a higher efficiency lighting scheme. Be sure to ask them to consider occupancy rates and light intensity levels for different areas. If you receive a quotation for new fixtures I recommend that you request to have the quotation written with line item cost for each type of fixture and sets of fixtures including the current energy usage, proposed energy usage and savings for each. Review the quotation and identify the fixtures which do not have a good payback and eliminate them from the project. Often this process of elimination will help you to reduce the overall project cost and result in an excellent ROI.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the correct amount of light at the correct time with efficient fixtures.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas Mort</a>&nbsp;is a Senior Auditor with Thomas Mort Consulting.</em>\n\nTo read&nbsp;<strong>the next six Sustainability Projects</strong>&nbsp;from this series please make your selection below:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/hvac-systems/seven-sustainability-projects-heat-recovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heat Recovery</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/hvac-systems/seven-sustainability-projects-hvac-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HVAC Optimization</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/lighting/project-implementation/sustainability-projects/lighting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Implementation</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/technology/instrumentation/seven-sustainability-projects-metering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metering</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/system-assessments/compressor-controls/seven-sustainability-projects-air-compressors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Air Compressors</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.airbestpractices.com/sustainability-projects/bill-mgmt/demand-control/seven-sustainability-projects-demand-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand Control</a>","Seven Sustainability Projects: Lighting Optimization","","inherit","closed","closed","","8-revision-v1","","","2018-10-18 16:55:08","2018-10-18 16:55:08","",8,"http://savingwithenergy.local/8-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

My studies have found 7 key (or common) areas where low cost practical projects can be implemented. Combined, these projects provide savings exceeding 10% of the annual energy spend of a typical industrial facility - with an average payback of less than one year.\n\nThis month’s article will focus on Lighting. Optimizing the lighting system can help reduce annual energy costs by approximately 2%. Lighting is a popular energy saving project and many facilities have already begun projects in this area. Often some key points are overlooked resulting in project costs being higher than necessary. Understanding the correct requirements can significantly reduce capital costs.\n<h3>Lighting Energy Costs and Project Objectives</h3>\nThe factory used for this example is a facility with 149,000 sq. ft. including manufacturing floor, warehouse, and office areas. The factory produces small metal and plastic injection-molded components. The annual energy spend for the facility is $1,483,000. There are 125 Metal Halide light fixtures and 355 fluorescent light fixtures. Lighting energy costs are 4.5% of the total energy spend or $67,200 per year. The objective of a lighting optimization project is to:\n\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the <strong>correct amount</strong> of light at the <strong>correct time</strong> with <strong>efficient fixtures</strong>.\n\nSymptoms which can help identify the need for a lighting project include:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Light levels are higher than necessary for the type of work being accomplished.</li>\n 	<li>Light fixtures are at a greater distance than necessary from the work area or in improper position.</li>\n 	<li>Excess lights are operating in areas without people working under the lights.</li>\n 	<li>The current light fixtures are not high efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image1_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#1 400 watt metal halide light fixtures.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image2_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#2 These 6 bulb T-8 Fluorescent fixtures use 50% less energy</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #1: Understand Current Lighting Status</h3>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image3.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#3 Lights near windows are wasting energy.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image4.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#4 Often light fixtures are obstructed.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nIf minimizing capital expenditure is important, then the sequential steps of a lighting project need to be followed.

The current energy cost of the 125 Metal Halide light fixtures is $46,563 per year.\n\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n125 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $46,563 /year\n<h3>Step #3: Determine the Correct Amount of Light:</h3>\nThere were sixty (60) fixtures which could be moved closer to the work area. By moving them closer, we were able to eliminate twenty (20) fixtures resulting in a energy savings of $7,450.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image6.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#6 A simple light sensor can shut down lights when the sun is shining.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n20 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hrs/week X 50 weeks per yr X $0.102/kwh = $7,450 /year\n<h3>Step #4: Use Lighting Only When Needed:</h3>\nTurning off the lights when a person is not working under the lights is another opportunity. Using occupancy sensors, we found thirty (30) lights in storage areas and warehouse aisles that could be turned off an additional eighty (80) hours per week. The savings was $5,385.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image7.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#7 These lights are turned off by sensors when the sunlight is available.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n30 X 440 watts/1,000 X 80 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $5,385 /year\n<h3>Step #5: Use Energy-Efficient Fixtures:</h3>\nUpgrading the lights to high-efficiency light fixtures will reduce the energy use per fixture by 50% and use 220 watts per fixture vs the original 440 watt. Remember we eliminated 20 lights and reduced the hours of 30 more lights. (Reference photos #1 and #2)\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image8.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#8 Lowering the lights from the ceiling reduces energy waste.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n75 X 220 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $13,969 /year\n\n30 X 220 watts/1,000 X 86 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $2,895 /year\n\nTotal savings for high efficiency = $16,846/year\n<h3>Step #6: Calculate total Energy Savings and ROI</h3>\nThe total energy savings per year is $29,681. This is the sum of upgrading lights to high efficency fixtures ($16,846 savings), using lights only when needed ($5,385), and providing the correct amount of light ($7,450).\n\nThe costs involved with generating these savings include:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Materials: the light fixture used to replace the 440 watt metal halide fixture is a T8 6 lamp fluorescent fixture, 32 watts per bulb. The cost is $205.00 USD including the motion sensor, the electrical cord and plug, hangars, and safety chain. Calculation: 105 new fixtures x $205.00 = $21,525 for the cost of the project.</li>\n 	<li>Labor: In house labor was used to install the fixtures-no cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image9.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#9 An occupancy sensor can help determine the amount of time lights are on without people in the area.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nIn this lighting optimization project, annual energy savings were $29,681 with project costs of $21,525. The simple ROI on the project is 8.7 months.\n<h3>Audits and Surveys</h3>\nLighting vendors are often willing to help perform your lighting surveys and provide recommendations for a higher efficiency lighting scheme. Be sure to ask them to consider occupancy rates and light intensity levels for different areas. If you receive a quotation for new fixtures I recommend that you request to have the quotation written with line item cost for each type of fixture and sets of fixtures including the current energy usage, proposed energy usage and savings for each. Review the quotation and identify the fixtures which do not have a good payback and eliminate them from the project. Often this process of elimination will help you to reduce the overall project cost and result in an excellent ROI.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the correct amount of light at the correct time with efficient fixtures.\n\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas Mort</a> is a Senior Auditor with Thomas Mort Consulting.</em>","Seven Sustainability Projects: Lighting Optimization","","inherit","closed","closed","","8-revision-v1","","","2018-10-18 20:05:36","2018-10-18 20:05:36","",8,"http://savingwithenergy.local/8-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

My studies have found seven (7) key (or common) areas where low cost practical projects can be implemented. Combined, these projects provide savings exceeding 10% of the annual energy spend with an average payback of less than one year.\n\nThis month’s article will focus on the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) component of energy management. As you read this article many of you may just be exiting this year’s long cold winter season. It may still be fresh on your mind just how much extra energy costs are because of winter heating. I will focus on the subject of winter heating but the concepts also apply to air- conditioned manufacturing facilities.\n<h3>HVAC Optimization Project Objectives</h3>\nWe can describe our HVAC Optimization project as an effort to reduce costs and energy for heating and air conditioning by improved control of exhaust air. The symptoms to help identify the opportunities for this project include:\n<ol type=\"1\">\n 	<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol type=\"1\">\n 	<li>The facility has a large amount of air exchange (air changes per hour)</li>\n 	<li>The facility requires heating during the winter months.</li>\n 	<li>The existing ventilation system does not have optimization controls.\n<ol type=\"1\">\n 	<li>Gas used in August = 4,657 mmbtus. X 12 months = 55,884 mmbtu (gas for production)</li>\n 	<li>Total gas used in 1 year = 67,632 mmbtus</li>\n 	<li>Total gas used – gas used for production = 67,632 – 55,884 = 11,748 mmbtus (gas used for winter heat)</li>\n 	<li>At an average cost for gas of $9.80/mmbtu the cost for winter heating is $115,130 per year.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Take a look around your facility.

Many times exhaust hoods are sucking the air out of an area even when there is no production at the machine.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #1: Calculate Gas Costs for Winter Heating</h3>\nTo begin this project you will need some basic information about the costs related to winter heat and the amount of air exchange happening on the manufacturing floor. A quick check for winter heating costs is to take the monthly gas bills and make a table of the amount of gas used each month as in the table below.\n\nDoes the amount of gas used increase during the winter months? If so, estimate the amount of gas used during a typical non-heating month such as August. Multiply this amount by 12 months to get an estimate of the amount of gas used for production that is not related to the weather. Now add the total amount of gas used for the year and subtract the amount used for production. This will give you an average amount of gas that is related to the cold weather.\n\nThe next step is to estimate approximately how many hours winter heat is required per year. Adding up the hours during the winter months from November through March provides a rough estimate. A more accurate number can be derived by adding up all the days where the average temperature is &lt; 56 F. This number can be found by using the free data available in the website <a title=\"www.weatherunderground.com/history\" href=\"http://www.weatherunderground.com/history\">www.weatherunderground.com/history</a>. Enter your zip code and choose the selection “history”. From this data you can also determine what the average temperature was during the heating season. In our sample factory from central Ohio we found there were 3,960 hour per year the temperature was below 56 F and the average temperature was 42 F. The differential temperature is 56 – 42 = 14 degrees.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/marchimage7.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #2: Calculate Amount of Exhaust Air it’s Heating Costs</h3>\nAnother piece of data is to know the amount of exhaust air that is being removed from the factory by dust collectors, furnace exhausts, roof and wall exhausts, etc. Sometimes you can find this data in the environmental survey reports. Another way is to measure the air flow using a Velometer. System name-plate data can be used but is often far different from the actual exhaust flow. HVAC service personnel often have a small probe meter than can be inserted into a duct and determine the flow rate. In my sample factory the volume of exhaust air is 100,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm).\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/marchImage%208_th.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nWith this data we can roughly calculate the cost of heating the make-up air and then rejecting it back into the countryside. The formula is: Differential Temperature x Flow rate (cfm) x heating hours/yr x cost of gas x 0.00000182 = annual cost\n\n1. 14 degrees x 100,000 cfm x 3,960 hours x $9.80/mmbtu x 0.00000182 = $98,000 per year.\n\nThink about this: Every 1,000 cfm of air that is being exhausted costs $1,000 per year or $1.00 per cfm. A small squirrel cage fan of 1 horse power can eject 3,000 cfm or $3,000 of heated air.\n<h3>Step #3: Opportunities to Reduce Cost</h3>\nWhat are some of the opportunities to reduce cost in this sample model?\n\nReduce the roof exhaust air by reversing the flow of the roof exhaust units and distributing the air into the roof area of the factory using flexible distribution ducting as shown in the photo below. Our model factory was under negative pressure and drawing in cold air from the truck bays and other doors, windows, and cracks. This caused the need for local heaters while hot air was going out the roof. Reducing the exhaust air by 30,000 cfm at $1.00/cfm will save $30,000 per year. A plant in central Ohio recently applied these principals and even though the 2008/2009 winter has been extra cold they have not run the large steam boiler system yet this year to heat the manufacturing areas.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/marchImage%209_th.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/marchImage%2010_th.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Fresh air make-up tubes and fans can be used to distribute the cold air from outside and mix it with the warm ceiling air. These systems help reduce negative pressure problems and can significantly reduce the winter heating costs.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nShutting down excess exhaust hoods during periods of reduced production can also help reduce the heating costs. Twenty (20) exhausters could be shut down for 80 hours per week (50% of the time)\n20 exhausters x 1,500 cfm/exhauster x $1.00/cfm x 50% of the time = $15,000 of savings per year.\n\nLook for any areas where the exhaust flow can be reduced during periods of reduced production.\n<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\nExhausting air is expensive. Every cubic foot of air that is exhausted means an equal cubic foot of air must be returned. If it is cold outside and you have to heat this return air it costs $$$. Challenge everyone in your facility to look for excess exhaust air, opportunities to supply fresh air to hot areas, and to find way to shut down or slow down roof exhausts during winter months.","HVAC Optimization","","publish","open","open","","hvac-optimization","","","2018-10-19 22:44:05","2018-10-19 22:44:05","",0,"http://savingwithenergy.local/?p=51",0,"post","",0),

Challenge everyone in your facility to look for excess exhaust air, opportunities to supply fresh air to hot areas, and to find way to shut down or slow down roof exhausts during winter months.","HVAC Optimization","","inherit","closed","closed","","51-revision-v1","","","2018-10-19 22:42:54","2018-10-19 22:42:54","",51,"http://savingwithenergy.local/51-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

This simple table below has proven to be a very useful way to organize this data. It allows you to look at year over year month to month comparisons and to see a lot of data on one page. Production measures can be anything from direct labor hours, parts produced, pounds produced, or $ sales. Some plants use a more detailed level by using $ sales minus the cost of material or in other terms the value add.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Interval Data</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second level of metering and one of the most important to begin the detailed analysis necessary to identify projects and to validate the results is interval data. Interval data for electricity would be 15 or 30 minute electric demand or energy measurements. Most often this is available directly from the utility company. In some cases you would need to pay a monthly cost for using the service and the electric company may need to install a different type of meter. You may also have to provide a telephone line to the meter. I have found this to be the most valuable tool to-date in identifying, quantifying, and verifying project results. The data is most useful if it can be read by a computer in almost real time. Our memories are not always so good so if you are looking at one month old data it may be difficult to remember exactly what event caused the change on the graph.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you cannot get the data from the utility company I have found a supplier who makes a relatively low cost solution that allows you to collect interval data from the electric meter, and then even add additional data measures which are then sent to a computer for real time monitoring.

Production levels are overlaid with the interval data. This measurement is an excellent management tool for Monday morning staff meetings. Targets are set in relations to production levels and then the targets are reviewed during the meeting to make corrections or set new targets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Natural Gas</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next level of measurement is for plants that use a significant amount of natural gas. Many gas suppliers are now able to provide interval data, sometimes hourly but most often daily. Using gas interval data along with daily weather data a very useful correlation can be developed. It can be quickly determined how sensitive the facility is to outside temperature changes by noting changes in the gas usage. Plants with large exhaust systems or rapid air changes will see gas usage rise very quickly when the temperature drops.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your facility has multiple buildings of a significant size then besides having interval metering for electric and gas at the main entrance meter the same should be set up for each of the other main buildings.

When presenting an Energy Workshop a question I always ask the participants is this: “How many of you already know that compressed air is one of the most expensive energy forms to waste?” Everyone acknowledges&nbsp;Yes”. I then ask the question: “If we all know it is an expensive form of energy to waste, then why have the previous participants identified more than $9 million of savings with low cost projects?.” The root cause is primarily due to a lack of measurement. Remember the saying, “You cannot control what you cannot measure.” Many facilities use a rough form of measurement. They count the number of compressors that are needed to meet the demand. 1, 2, 3, etc. Having to turn on an extra compressor indicates either air leaks or is excused as due to an increase in production.<br>This article will briefly review some simple means of measurement, identifying and quantifying the cost of operating a partially loaded compressor, and list remedies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Compressed Air Project Objectives</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can describe our Compressed Air Optimization project as an effort to reduce operating costs of the compressed air system by benchmarking the energy usage, implementing projects and procedures to reduce load, with a goal to shut off a partially loaded compressor. The symptoms to help identify the opportunities for this project include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>The facility operates with more than one air compressor and one is partially loaded.</li><li>Compressed air is used to stir, agitate, cool, dry, or position parts or equipment.</li><li>The compressed air system pressure is higher than required for the majority of equipment.</li><li>Supply valves are left open on equipment when it is not producing parts.</li><li>Site surveys identified multiple air leaks.</li><li>The electric load of the compressed air system does not follow changes in plant production.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step #1: Measure energy costs of air compressors</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A very useful low cost tool to begin analysis is the same that was described in the past article for demand control. Using simple data loggers and current transformers is an effective way to measure the energy use and patterns of use for the compressed air system. Install a data logger and current transformer on each operating air compressor. Set the data loggers to read every 30 seconds and collect readings for at least 7 days. The measured data can then be graphed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Analysis of this data can give use some key data. In my example one of the compressors is operating at full capacity and the other is operating partially loaded. From the measured data we can estimate the cost to run both of these compressors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The partially loaded compressor is more expensive per unit of air produced. Consider that the partially loaded compressor is producing an average output of 114 scfm and yet costs $17,690 per year to operate. This gives us a great potential project. If we can shut down the partially loaded compressor we can save $17,690 per year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Graph showing a partial loaded compressor and a fully loaded compressor</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Annual cost of a partial loaded compressor</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step #2: Manage Compressed Air Demand Events</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We need to go out into the factory and identify sufficient projects to reduce the compressed air load sufficient to allow shutting off this compressor. (Did you know that 114 scfm is equal to approximately 4 x 1/8 inch air leaks.) If we work from the basis that projects with a payback of less than one year are acceptable we could spend up to $17,000 to reduce this load. The good news is that we usually don’t have to spend even that much money.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One way to reduce some of the load is to insure that the supply valves to machines or work areas are shut when products are not being produced. The following graph shows the results of a project were the data loggers were installed on the compressor and the valves that workers normally left open were closed in series. As you can see from the graph, as the valves were closed the load on the compressor continued to decrease. In this plant, procedures were implemented and auto shut off valves installed on some machines. The results were that the plant was able to run with one less compressor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Closing valves on machines without production reduces load</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Reducing system pressure is another piece of the puzzle. Often plants run at a pressure higher than is required for the majority of the equipment. The reason may be a certain set of equipment requires a higher pressure or distribution lines restrict flow to sections further away from the compressors. Identifying the specific areas and using an air amplifier to increase the pressure or installing extra air receiver tanks to overcome pressure drops are typical solutions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Air Receiver Tank Upgrade</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Often an extra compressor is left running (the partially loaded compressor) to be ready for short period demands caused by cleaning, special processes, etc. Since it is not known just when this extra demand will arise the extra compressor is left on. Air receiver tanks coupled with flow controller valves can often eliminate the need for the extra compressor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Flow Controller example</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step #3: Identify Inappropriate Uses of Compressed Air</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Surveying the factory to identify areas where compressed air is being used to agitate, mix, cool, or dry provides another potential area to reduce the load. Air powered motors used for mixing can often be replaced by electric motors using more than four (4) times less energy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When compressed air is being used to dry, cool, or position material there are solutions to use less energy. Air knives can be changed to a design that uses lower pressure high volume blowers instead of using the compressed air.

When presenting an Energy Workshop a question I always ask the participants is this: “How many of you already know that compressed air is one of the most expensive energy forms to waste?” Everyone acknowledges&nbsp;Yes”. I then ask the question: “If we all know it is an expensive form of energy to waste, then why have the previous participants identified more than $9 million of savings with low cost projects?.” The root cause is primarily due to a lack of measurement. Remember the saying, “You cannot control what you cannot measure.” Many facilities use a rough form of measurement. They count the number of compressors that are needed to meet the demand. 1, 2, 3, etc. Having to turn on an extra compressor indicates either air leaks or is excused as due to an increase in production.<br>This article will briefly review some simple means of measurement, identifying and quantifying the cost of operating a partially loaded compressor, and list remedies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Compressed Air Project Objectives</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can describe our Compressed Air Optimization project as an effort to reduce operating costs of the compressed air system by benchmarking the energy usage, implementing projects and procedures to reduce load, with a goal to shut off a partially loaded compressor. The symptoms to help identify the opportunities for this project include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>The facility operates with more than one air compressor and one is partially loaded.</li><li>Compressed air is used to stir, agitate, cool, dry, or position parts or equipment.</li><li>The compressed air system pressure is higher than required for the majority of equipment.</li><li>Supply valves are left open on equipment when it is not producing parts.</li><li>Site surveys identified multiple air leaks.</li><li>The electric load of the compressed air system does not follow changes in plant production.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step #1: Measure energy costs of air compressors</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A very useful low cost tool to begin analysis is the same that was described in the past article for demand control. Using simple data loggers and current transformers is an effective way to measure the energy use and patterns of use for the compressed air system. Install a data logger and current transformer on each operating air compressor. Set the data loggers to read every 30 seconds and collect readings for at least 7 days. The measured data can then be graphed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Analysis of this data can give use some key data. In my example one of the compressors is operating at full capacity and the other is operating partially loaded. From the measured data we can estimate the cost to run both of these compressors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The partially loaded compressor is more expensive per unit of air produced. Consider that the partially loaded compressor is producing an average output of 114 scfm and yet costs $17,690 per year to operate. This gives us a great potential project. If we can shut down the partially loaded compressor we can save $17,690 per year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Graph showing a partial loaded compressor and a fully loaded compressor</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Annual cost of a partial loaded compressor</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step #2: Manage Compressed Air Demand Events</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We need to go out into the factory and identify sufficient projects to reduce the compressed air load sufficient to allow shutting off this compressor. (Did you know that 114 scfm is equal to approximately 4 x 1/8 inch air leaks.) If we work from the basis that projects with a payback of less than one year are acceptable we could spend up to $17,000 to reduce this load. The good news is that we usually don’t have to spend even that much money.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One way to reduce some of the load is to insure that the supply valves to machines or work areas are shut when products are not being produced. The following graph shows the results of a project were the data loggers were installed on the compressor and the valves that workers normally left open were closed in series. As you can see from the graph, as the valves were closed the load on the compressor continued to decrease. In this plant, procedures were implemented and auto shut off valves installed on some machines. The results were that the plant was able to run with one less compressor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Closing valves on machines without production reduces load</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Reducing system pressure is another piece of the puzzle. Often plants run at a pressure higher than is required for the majority of the equipment. The reason may be a certain set of equipment requires a higher pressure or distribution lines restrict flow to sections further away from the compressors. Identifying the specific areas and using an air amplifier to increase the pressure or installing extra air receiver tanks to overcome pressure drops are typical solutions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Air Receiver Tank Upgrade</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Often an extra compressor is left running (the partially loaded compressor) to be ready for short period demands caused by cleaning, special processes, etc. Since it is not known just when this extra demand will arise the extra compressor is left on. Air receiver tanks coupled with flow controller valves can often eliminate the need for the extra compressor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Flow Controller example</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step #3: Identify Inappropriate Uses of Compressed Air</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Surveying the factory to identify areas where compressed air is being used to agitate, mix, cool, or dry provides another potential area to reduce the load. Air powered motors used for mixing can often be replaced by electric motors using more than four (4) times less energy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When compressed air is being used to dry, cool, or position material there are solutions to use less energy. Air knives can be changed to a design that uses lower pressure high volume blowers instead of using the compressed air. I recently reviewed a project where the plant was using compressed air to dry parts after a water bath. Changing the existing air knives to a blower system resulted in shutting down a 150 hp partially loaded air compressor and replacing it with a 25 hp blower.

This plant has more than 30 buildings, 4 large manufacturing halls, a central heating boiler plant, and miles of steam and compressed air distribution lines. Without metering, this project would have taken months of measurements and even then there would be many estimations. A few years ago the plant had installed metering to measure the energy into each of the main production halls and to the air compressors and gas boilers.

This simple table below has proven to be a very useful way to organize this data. It allows you to look at year over year month to month comparisons and to see a lot of data on one page. Production measures can be anything from direct labor hours, parts produced, pounds produced, or $ sales. Some plants use a more detailed level by using $ sales minus the cost of material or in other terms the value add.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Interval Data</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second level of metering and one of the most important to begin the detailed analysis necessary to identify projects and to validate the results is interval data. Interval data for electricity would be 15 or 30 minute electric demand or energy measurements. Most often this is available directly from the utility company. In some cases you would need to pay a monthly cost for using the service and the electric company may need to install a different type of meter. You may also have to provide a telephone line to the meter. I have found this to be the most valuable tool to-date in identifying, quantifying, and verifying project results. The data is most useful if it can be read by a computer in almost real time. Our memories are not always so good so if you are looking at one month old data it may be difficult to remember exactly what event caused the change on the graph.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you cannot get the data from the utility company I have found a supplier who makes a relatively low cost solution that allows you to collect interval data from the electric meter, and then even add additional data measures which are then sent to a computer for real time monitoring.

I’ve taken the data and color-coded it to show the different tariff rates. The color red represents the highest cost electricity and therefore is the area we begin analyzing to determine how to reduce the use during this period. Production levels are overlaid with the interval data. This measurement is an excellent management tool for Monday morning staff meetings. Targets are set in relations to production levels and then the targets are reviewed during the meeting to make corrections or set new targets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Natural Gas</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next level of measurement is for plants that use a significant amount of natural gas. Many gas suppliers are now able to provide interval data, sometimes hourly but most often daily. Using gas interval data along with daily weather data a very useful correlation can be developed. It can be quickly determined how sensitive the facility is to outside temperature changes by noting changes in the gas usage. Plants with large exhaust systems or rapid air changes will see gas usage rise very quickly when the temperature drops.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your facility has multiple buildings of a significant size then besides having interval metering for electric and gas at the main entrance meter the same should be set up for each of the other main buildings. This is referred to as sub-metering.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Sub-metering with Data Loggers</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many ways to sub-meter. I will focus on a low cost method that I have been using for the last 10 years with great success. I have been using small data logging devices called Hobos and have distributed thousands of these devices in plants around the world.

I like having one device, with one program that I can use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My primary use of these devices has been to measure electric current. I use the data logger along with a current transformer to measure one phase of a motor or heating circuit. The batteries in the data loggers last for about a year so I install the units and take the readings monthly or more often if I am studying a piece of equipment.

Nearly half of all the savings that have been identified by attendees of my workshops have been identified and quantified by these data loggers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve found a new device for measuring compressed air flow to a piece of equipment using the data logger to graph the data over time. Recently this device has help avoid buying the wrong sized air compressor for a production line. We installed the device on an operating line and monitored the flow for a full week. From the data we were able to determine the correct amount of air that was needed. Since this device was easy to install and remove, we are now performing a similar test at another plant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another measurement device I have recently began using is a thermal imaging camera. I had no idea what I was missing out on until I begun using this device. The price has come down significantly and with this $3,000 camera (reference:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.extech.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.extech.com</a>) I been able to enhance plant audits and maybe more importantly provide stronger evidence to plant management on their need to change. It is very hard to argue against a picture that shows cold air coming into a negative pressure building, an exhaust fan left on when the heating system is running, or heating units blasting away in a warehouse with the door open and no one in the area. This device provides a method to quickly scan a large area and identify motors that are left running and hot water heating systems that are not fully isolated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve recently put together a tool-box of containing a set of useful measurement devices for analyzing a plant.

I found a great shipping box that protects all of the items even in with the rough airline baggage handling. (Reference:<a href=\"http://www.techtoolsupply.com/\">www.techtoolsupply.com</a>) Some clients have been renting the box but are now wanting their own box and they are sharing it among their other plants.

My suggestion is not to wait until you can get an approval for a plant wide integrated metering system. Begin with the basic measures described above and enhance it with some portable metering. Identify and implement good measurable energy projects, show the savings, and use this to support projects for a more automated system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Metering","This is the excerpt ","inherit","closed","closed","","53-autosave-v1","","","2018-10-22 17:53:44","2018-10-22 17:53:44","",53,"http://savingwithenergy.local/53-autosave-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

My studies have found 7 key (or common) areas where low cost practical projects can be implemented. Combined, these projects provide savings exceeding 10% of the annual energy spend of a typical industrial facility - with an average payback of less than one year.\n\nThis month’s article will focus on Lighting. Optimizing the lighting system can help reduce annual energy costs by approximately 2%. Lighting is a popular energy saving project and many facilities have already begun projects in this area. Often some key points are overlooked resulting in project costs being higher than necessary. Understanding the correct requirements can significantly reduce capital costs.\n<h3>Lighting Energy Costs and Project Objectives</h3>\nThe factory used for this example is a facility with 149,000 sq. ft. including manufacturing floor, warehouse, and office areas. The factory produces small metal and plastic injection-molded components. The annual energy spend for the facility is $1,483,000. There are 125 Metal Halide light fixtures and 355 fluorescent light fixtures. Lighting energy costs are 4.5% of the total energy spend or $67,200 per year. The objective of a lighting optimization project is to:\n\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the <strong>correct amount</strong> of light at the <strong>correct time</strong> with <strong>efficient fixtures</strong>.\n\nSymptoms which can help identify the need for a lighting project include:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Light levels are higher than necessary for the type of work being accomplished.</li>\n 	<li>Light fixtures are at a greater distance than necessary from the work area or in improper position.</li>\n 	<li>Excess lights are operating in areas without people working under the lights.</li>\n 	<li>The current light fixtures are not high efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image1_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#1 400 watt metal halide light fixtures.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image2_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#2 These 6 bulb T-8 Fluorescent fixtures use 50% less energy</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #1: Understand Current Lighting Status</h3>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image3.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#3 Lights near windows are wasting energy.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image4.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#4 Often light fixtures are obstructed.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nIf minimizing capital expenditure is important, then the sequential steps of a lighting project need to be followed. The first step is to understand your current lighting status. This would include a survey of the major facility areas such as the manufacturing floor and warehouses. The survey should include the following:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Number of fixtures</li>\n 	<li>Bulb type and watts per bulb (example: 400 watt MH or 96 watt T12x4 ft fluorescent)</li>\n 	<li>Number of bulbs per fixture</li>\n 	<li>Hours per week the fixture is on without someone working under the fixture. (reference photos #5 and #9)</li>\n 	<li>Is it possible to move the fixture closer to the work areas such as lowering it down or aligning it so the light is not blocked by an obstruction? (reference photo #4 and #8)</li>\n 	<li>Is ambient light available from windows or skylights which may allow the light fixture to be off during sunlight hours? (reference photos #6 and #7)</li>\n 	<li>Is the light level reduced in non-precision work areas such as walk-ways and storage when compared to work-station areas?</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image5.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#5 Lights on without workers and excessive lighting in non-work areas.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Step #2: Determine Existing Energy Costs</h3>\nThe second step is to determine the value of changing the status of the existing light fixtures. For this example, I will consider the 440 watt Metal Halide light fixtures which are commonly used in many industrial facilities. The current energy cost of the 125 Metal Halide light fixtures is $46,563 per year.\n\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n125 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $46,563 /year\n<h3>Step #3: Determine the Correct Amount of Light:</h3>\nThere were sixty (60) fixtures which could be moved closer to the work area. By moving them closer, we were able to eliminate twenty (20) fixtures resulting in a energy savings of $7,450.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image6.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#6 A simple light sensor can shut down lights when the sun is shining.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n20 X 440 watts/1,000 X 166 hrs/week X 50 weeks per yr X $0.102/kwh = $7,450 /year\n<h3>Step #4: Use Lighting Only When Needed:</h3>\nTurning off the lights when a person is not working under the lights is another opportunity. Using occupancy sensors, we found thirty (30) lights in storage areas and warehouse aisles that could be turned off an additional eighty (80) hours per week. The savings was $5,385.\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image7.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#7 These lights are turned off by sensors when the sunlight is available.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<strong>Calculation:</strong>\n\n# of Fixtures X watts per fixture/1,000 X hours on per week X weeks per year X $/kwh = $/year\n\n30 X 440 watts/1,000 X 80 hours/week X 50 weeks per year X $0.102/kwh = $5,385 /year\n<h3>Step #5: Use Energy-Efficient Fixtures:</h3>\nUpgrading the lights to high-efficiency light fixtures will reduce the energy use per fixture by 50% and use 220 watts per fixture vs the original 440 watt. Remember we eliminated 20 lights and reduced the hours of 30 more lights.

This is the sum of upgrading lights to high efficency fixtures ($16,846 savings), using lights only when needed ($5,385), and providing the correct amount of light ($7,450).\n\nThe costs involved with generating these savings include:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Materials: the light fixture used to replace the 440 watt metal halide fixture is a T8 6 lamp fluorescent fixture, 32 watts per bulb. The cost is $205.00 USD including the motion sensor, the electrical cord and plug, hangars, and safety chain. Calculation: 105 new fixtures x $205.00 = $21,525 for the cost of the project.</li>\n 	<li>Labor: In house labor was used to install the fixtures-no cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.airbestpractices.com/sites/default/files/pictures/image9.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>#9 An occupancy sensor can help determine the amount of time lights are on without people in the area.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\nIn this lighting optimization project, annual energy savings were $29,681 with project costs of $21,525. The simple ROI on the project is 8.7 months.\n<h3>Audits and Surveys</h3>\nLighting vendors are often willing to help perform your lighting surveys and provide recommendations for a higher efficiency lighting scheme. Be sure to ask them to consider occupancy rates and light intensity levels for different areas. If you receive a quotation for new fixtures I recommend that you request to have the quotation written with line item cost for each type of fixture and sets of fixtures including the current energy usage, proposed energy usage and savings for each. Review the quotation and identify the fixtures which do not have a good payback and eliminate them from the project. Often this process of elimination will help you to reduce the overall project cost and result in an excellent ROI.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nReduce energy usage of the lighting systems by providing the correct amount of light at the correct time with efficient fixtures.\n\n<em><a href=\"mailto:tcmort@live.com\">Thomas Mort</a> is a Senior Auditor with Thomas Mort Consulting.</em>","Seven Sustainability Projects: Lighting Optimization","This month’s article will focus on Lighting.

He also knew the value of \nhistoric data over the course of months, not weeks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“I’m not a big fan of taking on major projects and recommending \nsubstantial investments with only two weeks of data,” Hoetzel said. \n“What is much better is to view up-to-the-minute data, capture months of\n that same data and compare it month to month. Only then can you make \ninformed decisions.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Initially, Hoetzel picked up where others left off and completed a \ncomplimentary leak study at Chicago Heights Steel, which operates two \nair compressor rooms. The study showed substantial compressed air \nleakage, which led to repair of the fixed leaks for a monthly average \nsavings of approximately 40,000 kWh. However, the savings were not \ncaptured because the air compressors had been run in modulation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yet Hoetzel knew Chicago Heights Steel could achieve greater energy \nsavings if it invested in data collection and a number of yet-to-be \ndetermined changes to its compressed air system. The challenge for \nHoetzel was to prove the value of investing in data monitoring to \ncontrols to Corral. As such, Corral decided to have the Airleader \nCompressor Master Control and Online Monitoring System installed on the \ncompressed air system to one compressor room on a pilot basis. The \nbaseline snapshot of the system would allow Hoetzel and Corral to make \ndecisions on changes to the system based on data rather than educated \nguesses or assumptions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Original Compressed Air System and Initial Data</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chicago Heights Steel originally operated three air compressors in \neach of its two compressor rooms.

A two-inch pipe connected the two compressor rooms, \nalthough each room operated independently from the other and the pipe \nwas essentially unusable for compressed air control.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Effectively monitoring the compressed air system required the \ninstallation of kW meters on each air compressor. Also installed were \nflow meters and dew point sensors in each compressor room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Thermal Mass Flow Meter and Dew Point Sensors were installed in each air compressor room. Photo courtesy of CS Instruments.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The master control system gave Hoetzel and Corral the ability to view\n real-time data at any time from their offices to gain insight into air \ncompressor performance and understand the true cost of the compressed \nair system, down to the second. Importantly, the controller provided \nChicago Heights Steel with the data it needed to make incremental \nchanges to the compressed air system – including the ability to leverage\n energy savings and an incentive program offered by ComEd to fund \nimprovements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Incremental System Improvements and Savings</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the master control system, both Hoetzel and Corral were able to \nestablish benchmarks for performance and evaluate a wealth of data \nincluding load and idle operation, consumed kWh, air generated and \nenergy costs based on local utility rates, and performance parameters \nfor each air compressor. The system also provides real-time information \non overall compressed airflow and dew points.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During the initial four-month period from December to March, data \ndemonstrated no significant savings had been achieved solely by fixing \nthe compressed air leaks. It also showed how the desiccant compressed \nair dryers resulted in a huge energy drain given the need to purge \ndesiccant. Based on the data and an incentive program offered by ComEd, \nCorral opted to replace the desiccant dyers with cycling refrigerated \ncompressed air dryers, allowing Chicago Heights Steel to reduce \ncompressed air use by as much as one-third.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The information convinced Corral of the value in compressed air \nsystem data measuring and monitoring. That led to the extended use of \nthe master control system for both air compressor rooms.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, the savings combined with the ComEd incentive made it \neconomically feasible to replace the 2-inch pipe connecting the two air \ncompressors rooms with a 4-inch pipe. The new pipe was essential for \nfree airflow and the ability to use the Master Control System to supply \nthe compressed air to the plant from the appropriate air compressors \nfrom any compressor room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Demand-based Compressed Air Approach Implemented</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a next step in the project, Chicago Heights Steel and Airleader \nset out to optimize the compressed air system to satisfy demand for air \nat the lowest possible cost.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Optimization started with data. The master control system’s data \nconfirmed that the most effective approach delivering compressed air was\n for Chicago Heights Steel to end the practice of running its five \ncompressed air units continuously in modulation. That led to the \nimplementation of a demand-side approach to managing its compressed air.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The approach hinges on the use of Variable Speed Drive (VSD) air \ncompressors that operate based on air demand and the use of the master \ncontrol system to automatically control the operation of the compressors\n involved. Savings achieved to date also played a key role in the \ndecision to proceed with a new compressed air configuration and \nadditional compressed air storage capacity. The data collected and \nsavings together cleared the path for the air compressor equipment \nupgrade, the cost of which would be offset by the ComEd incentive of \n$177,714. Earlier, ComEd had provided an incentive of $11,000 for the \ncompressed air system leak repair.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The team analyzed data from the master controller and decided to \nreplace three fixed-drive air compressors with new units based on \nperformance output and the remaining productive life of the existing \nunits. The data also demonstrated further savings potential, which \nfurther fueled the decision to proceed with the upgrade. The new \ncompressed air system is as follows:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Compressor Room I</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>One 150 hp fixed-speed air compressor (original unit)</li><li>One 200 hp VSD air compressor (new unit)</li><li>One 75 hp VSD air compressor (new unit)</li><li>One cycling refrigerated compressed air dryer (replacing desiccant dryer)</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Compressor Room II</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>One 150 hp fixed-speed air compressor (new unit)</li><li>One 150 hp fixed-speed air compressor (original unit)</li><li>One 75 hp fixed-speed air compressor (original unit)</li><li>One cycling refrigerated compressed air dryer (replacing desiccant dryer)</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, the system supplies compressed air throughout the plant \ntypically via the new 200 hp VSD air compressor in combination with the \n75 hp VSD unit.

Among them is Chicago Heights Steel, which\n set out to gain control of the costs – as long as it could implement a \nhighly cost effective approach. Chicago Heights Steel (<a href=\"http://www.chs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.chs.com</a>)\n is the only specialty steel market mill in the United States that rolls\n billet and rail steel in addition to supply a range of products to \ncustomers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chicago Heights Steel President Bradley Corral said his goal was to \nbetter understand compressed use in the plant, especially since the \ncompany had added air compressors to its operation from time to time \nover the years to meet drops in system pressure throughout the plant. He\n also wanted the ability to more closely evaluate electrical usage \nplant-wide.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Over the years, we’ve seen our energy usage and the corresponding \ncosts increase. I wanted to know where we’re using all of this \nelectricity,” Corral said. “I also wanted to understand where we’re \nusing all of this compressed air since we added horsepower to meet the \nneed for it.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two independent companies performed ComEd air compressor system leak \nstudies that were left unfinished. Needing more answers and a \ncost-effective approach to address the issue, Chicago Heights Steel \nconsulted with Jan Hoetzel, Executive Board Member of the Compressed Air\n Challenge <a href=\"http://www.compressedairchallenge.org/executive-committee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">http://www.compressedairchallenge.org/executive-committee</a> and Principal of Airleader USA, Grand Rapids, Mich.

He also knew the value of \nhistoric data over the course of months, not weeks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“I’m not a big fan of taking on major projects and recommending \nsubstantial investments with only two weeks of data,” Hoetzel said. \n“What is much better is to view up-to-the-minute data, capture months of\n that same data and compare it month to month. Only then can you make \ninformed decisions.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Initially, Hoetzel picked up where others left off and completed a \ncomplimentary leak study at Chicago Heights Steel, which operates two \nair compressor rooms. The study showed substantial compressed air \nleakage, which led to repair of the fixed leaks for a monthly average \nsavings of approximately 40,000 kWh. However, the savings were not \ncaptured because the air compressors had been run in modulation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yet Hoetzel knew Chicago Heights Steel could achieve greater energy \nsavings if it invested in data collection and a number of yet-to-be \ndetermined changes to its compressed air system. The challenge for \nHoetzel was to prove the value of investing in data monitoring to \ncontrols to Corral. As such, Corral decided to have the Airleader \nCompressor Master Control and Online Monitoring System installed on the \ncompressed air system to one compressor room on a pilot basis. The \nbaseline snapshot of the system would allow Hoetzel and Corral to make \ndecisions on changes to the system based on data rather than educated \nguesses or assumptions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Original Compressed Air System and Initial Data</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chicago Heights Steel originally operated three air compressors in \neach of its two compressor rooms.

A two-inch pipe connected the two compressor rooms, \nalthough each room operated independently from the other and the pipe \nwas essentially unusable for compressed air control.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Effectively monitoring the compressed air system required the \ninstallation of kW meters on each air compressor. Also installed were \nflow meters and dew point sensors in each compressor room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Thermal Mass Flow Meter and Dew Point Sensors were installed in each air compressor room. Photo courtesy of CS Instruments.</h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The master control system gave Hoetzel and Corral the ability to view\n real-time data at any time from their offices to gain insight into air \ncompressor performance and understand the true cost of the compressed \nair system, down to the second. Importantly, the controller provided \nChicago Heights Steel with the data it needed to make incremental \nchanges to the compressed air system – including the ability to leverage\n energy savings and an incentive program offered by ComEd to fund \nimprovements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Incremental System Improvements and Savings</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the master control system, both Hoetzel and Corral were able to \nestablish benchmarks for performance and evaluate a wealth of data \nincluding load and idle operation, consumed kWh, air generated and \nenergy costs based on local utility rates, and performance parameters \nfor each air compressor. The system also provides real-time information \non overall compressed airflow and dew points.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During the initial four-month period from December to March, data \ndemonstrated no significant savings had been achieved solely by fixing \nthe compressed air leaks. It also showed how the desiccant compressed \nair dryers resulted in a huge energy drain given the need to purge \ndesiccant. Based on the data and an incentive program offered by ComEd, \nCorral opted to replace the desiccant dyers with cycling refrigerated \ncompressed air dryers, allowing Chicago Heights Steel to reduce \ncompressed air use by as much as one-third.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The information convinced Corral of the value in compressed air \nsystem data measuring and monitoring. That led to the extended use of \nthe master control system for both air compressor rooms.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, the savings combined with the ComEd incentive made it \neconomically feasible to replace the 2-inch pipe connecting the two air \ncompressors rooms with a 4-inch pipe. The new pipe was essential for \nfree airflow and the ability to use the Master Control System to supply \nthe compressed air to the plant from the appropriate air compressors \nfrom any compressor room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Demand-based Compressed Air Approach Implemented</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a next step in the project, Chicago Heights Steel and Airleader \nset out to optimize the compressed air system to satisfy demand for air \nat the lowest possible cost.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Optimization started with data. The master control system’s data \nconfirmed that the most effective approach delivering compressed air was\n for Chicago Heights Steel to end the practice of running its five \ncompressed air units continuously in modulation. That led to the \nimplementation of a demand-side approach to managing its compressed air.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The approach hinges on the use of Variable Speed Drive (VSD) air \ncompressors that operate based on air demand and the use of the master \ncontrol system to automatically control the operation of the compressors\n involved. Savings achieved to date also played a key role in the \ndecision to proceed with a new compressed air configuration and \nadditional compressed air storage capacity. The data collected and \nsavings together cleared the path for the air compressor equipment \nupgrade, the cost of which would be offset by the ComEd incentive of \n$177,714. Earlier, ComEd had provided an incentive of $11,000 for the \ncompressed air system leak repair.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The team analyzed data from the master controller and decided to \nreplace three fixed-drive air compressors with new units based on \nperformance output and the remaining productive life of the existing \nunits. The data also demonstrated further savings potential, which \nfurther fueled the decision to proceed with the upgrade. The new \ncompressed air system is as follows:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Compressor Room I</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>One 150 hp fixed-speed air compressor (original unit)</li><li>One 200 hp VSD air compressor (new unit)</li><li>One 75 hp VSD air compressor (new unit)</li><li>One cycling refrigerated compressed air dryer (replacing desiccant dryer)</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Compressor Room II</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>One 150 hp fixed-speed air compressor (new unit)</li><li>One 150 hp fixed-speed air compressor (original unit)</li><li>One 75 hp fixed-speed air compressor (original unit)</li><li>One cycling refrigerated compressed air dryer (replacing desiccant dryer)</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, the system supplies compressed air throughout the plant \ntypically via the new 200 hp VSD air compressor in combination with the \n75 hp VSD unit.
